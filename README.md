# SWIM (Simple Web Interface for MIPS)

This was originally developed by Kevin Cahalan, Jerrett Longworth, Huy Nguyen, Evan Raiford, and Jimmie Smith at UCF as a senior design project.

A web-based emulator for MIPS64 made for educational purposes. Its emulation core supports over 60 real instructions and 20 pseudo-instuctions and an user interface that provides the following features:
- Step execute and execute code down to the individual [stages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_cycle)
- Upload files to SWIM and Copy code to the user's clipboard to be saved locally 
	- Note: For Chromium-based browsers on Mac, the user will have to manually copy-paste the code onto a text editor. This is done as followed:
		1. Click on the Editor window.
		2. Press `(Crtl/Cmd + A)` to select all text.
		3. Press `(Ctrl/Cmd + C)` to copy the text on your clipboard.
		4. Press `(Ctrl/Cmd + V)` to paste the text in your text editor to save the code.
- A register viewer that displays General Purpose and Floating Point registers with toggling to different views (decimal, binary, hexadecimal, float, double)
- A console viewer to display errors and suggestions on fixing them
- A memory viewer to see the code compiled and updated as it executes
- A visualization of the datapath to see the individual parts that make up the general and floating-point coprocessors and the values inside each wire
- Utilizes the [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) code library to provide:
	- Syntax highlighting of our custom language
	- Highlighting the previously executed line
	- Providing mouse hover information on instructions and errors
	- Expands the pseudo-instructions into their hardware equivalent upon assembling code

All of this wholly developed with the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) language with the interface built with the [Yew](https://yew.rs/) framework which uses [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) and JavaScript to house the emulation core and parser/assembler.

## Compiling

While SWIM is currently being hosted [here](https://swim-ucf.github.io/SWIM/), you can compile and run it locally on your browser as long as it supports WebAssembly.

1. Install the latest stable rust toolchain with `rustup` at https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
2. Install [trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/#install)
3. `git clone` the repository or download the source here
4. When you are in the root directory of the project, type `trunk serve --open` in your terminal to load it locally

## Licensing
